### Arches 5.0 release notes

The Arches team has been busy improving Arches and fixing several bugs as well.
Below you'll find a listing of more changes included in the latest release.

Some of the highlights:

- Dependency Upgrades - Arches now uses:
    - Python 3.7
    - Django 2.2
    - Elasticsearch 7.4
    - Postgres 12
    - PostGIS 3
- Task Management: Arches can now be configured to delegate background tasks using Celery
- Notifications: Arches can notify users when a task is complete and developers can add custom notifications
- Search Export: Users can export search results to CSV or shapefile formats.
- Search Components: Developers can now override search components to customize the search interface, or add their own search components
- Package Ontologies: Ontologies can now be loaded from a package
- The default ontology has been removed to better accommodate instances without ontologies or custom ontologies
- Workflows: Developers can design workflows to simplify data management operations for their users
- The tile server (TileStache) has been removed in favor of storing vector tiles directly in Postgres
- A grouping card component has been added to cards into a single card
- A map component has been added to manage multiple geometry nodes in a single map interface.
- The map widget has been upgraded with an improved interface
- Custom indexes have been added to allow developers to add their own indexes

### Important:
The method of creating generic relationships is still available in Arches. However, this feature will be deprecated in a future release. Users are strongly encouraged to use the Resource Instance datatype to relate resources. 

#### Upgrading Arches


1. Upgrade to Arches 4.4.3
2. Set up a Postgres 12 service with PostGIS 3.0. Ideally this will be on a separate server from the one supporting Arches 4. 
3. Carefully follow instructions to upgrade each Arches project database to Postgres 12. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html  
4. Install Elasticsearch 7.4
5. Install Python 3.6 or 3.7. If you are running Arches on Ubuntu 18.04 we recommend version 3.6
6. Create a Python 3 virtual environment, activate your new virtual environment and install Arches:

        python -m venv env
        source env/bin/activated
        (env) pip install arches --upgrade --no-binary :all:

7. Within your project with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:


        python manage.py migrate
        python manage.py es delete_indexes
        python manage.py es setup_indexes
        python manage.py es index_database


8. (optional) Install a message queue and set up the task manager.

#### Upgrading an Arches project

1.  Make the following changes to your project's package.json file:

    Add:  
         
         "@mapbox/geojsonhint": "^3.0.0"
         "@mapbox/mapbox-gl-geocoder": "^4.4.0"

    Upgrade:

        "@mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw": "1.1.2",
        "bootstrap": "3.3.7",
        "ckeditor": "^4.6.2",
        "knockout": "3.5.0",
        "mapbox-gl": "^1.0.0",
        "numeral": "^2.0.6",

    Remove: 

        "mathjs": "^3.11.4",
        "nvd3": "^1.8.5",

    and finally run: 
    
        `yarn install`

2. Because TileStache has been removed from core arches, any services that were provided by the tile server will need to be provided by another server such as GeoServer.

### Known Issues:
- The Docker install needs to be updated to support the dependency changes.
