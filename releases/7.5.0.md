### Breaking changes
None

### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version 7.4.0 before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the [Version 7.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.4.x/releases/7.4.0.md)

2. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding.

3. Upgrade to Arches 7.5.0
    ```
    pip install --upgrade arches==7.5.0
    ```

4. Uninstall mooted dev dependencies:
    ```
    pip uninstall webtest
    pip uninstall django-webtest
    pip uninstall django-nose
    ```

### Upgrading an Arches project

1. In urls.py, replace each `django.conf.urls.url()` call with `django.urls.re_path()` if it uses a regular expression, or `django.urls.path()` if it does not.

2. Replace any calls to `django.utils.translation.ugettext()` with `django.utils.translation.gettext()`.

3. In settings.py (or settings_local.py, etc.), remove `USE_L10N`.

4. Within your project, with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations  # commit the result
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Reindex your database:
   ```
   python manage.py es reindex_database
   ```

6. Update the JavaScript dependencies and devDependencies
    In the project's `package.json` file from `stable/7.4.0` to `stable/7.5.0`:
    ```    
    {
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/7.5.0",
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "arches-dev-dependencies": "archesproject/arches-dev-dependencies#stable/7.5.0"
        }
    ```

7. Start your application server in a separate terminal if it's not already running.

8. In the same terminal window where you ran `yarn` ( on the same level as `package.json` ), run `yarn start` or `yarn build_development`. This will generate your `media/build` directory.
   - If running your project in development:
     -  `yarn start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
      - `yarn build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
    - If running your project in production:
      - `yarn build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
      - Alternatively you can `cd ..` up a directory and run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assets and also call `collectstatic`.
  

9. If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    collectstatic
    ```
    and restart your server
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```
