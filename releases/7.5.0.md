### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version 7.4.0 before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the [Version 7.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/dev/7.4.x/releases/7.4.0.md)

2. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding.

3. Upgrade to Arches 7.5.0
    ```
    pip install --upgrade arches==7.5.0
    ```

### Upgrading an Arches project


1. Within your project, with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. Replace the webpack directory in your project with the webpack directory in Arches, except for webpack/webpack-node-modules-aliases.js

3. Update your settings.py file:
    1. Add the ARCHES_APPLICATIONS SETTING:

        ```ARCHES_APPLICATIONS = ()``` 

    2. Replace:
        ```
        STATICFILES_DIRS = (
            os.path.join(APP_ROOT, "media", "build"),
            os.path.join(APP_ROOT, "media"),
        ) + STATICFILES_DIRS
        ```
        with:
        ```
        STATICFILES_DIRS =  build_staticfiles_dirs(
            root_dir=ROOT_DIR,
            app_root=APP_ROOT,
            arches_applications=ARCHES_APPLICATIONS,
        )
        ```

   3. Replace:
        ```
        TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'].append(os.path.join(APP_ROOT, 'functions', 'templates'))
        TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'].append(os.path.join(APP_ROOT, 'widgets', 'templates'))
        TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'].insert(0, os.path.join(APP_ROOT, 'templates'))
        ```
        with:
        ```
        TEMPLATES = build_templates_config(
            root_dir=ROOT_DIR,
            debug=DEBUG,
            app_root=APP_ROOT,
            arches_applications=ARCHES_APPLICATIONS,
        )
        ```

   4. Replace:
        ```
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print(
                json.dumps(
                    {
                        "ARCHES_NAMESPACE_FOR_DATA_EXPORT": ARCHES_NAMESPACE_FOR_DATA_EXPORT,
                        "STATIC_URL": STATIC_URL,
                        "ROOT_DIR": ROOT_DIR,
                        "APP_ROOT": APP_ROOT,
                        "WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_PORT": WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_PORT,
                    }
                )
            )
            sys.stdout.flush()
        ```
        with:
        ```
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            transmit_webpack_django_config(
                root_dir=ROOT_DIR,
                app_root=APP_ROOT,
                arches_applications=ARCHES_APPLICATIONS,
                public_server_address=PUBLIC_SERVER_ADDRESS,
                static_url=STATIC_URL,
                webpack_development_server_port=WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_PORT,
            )
        ```

   5. If your project is running on a port other than 8000, set the PUBLIC_SERVER_ADDRESS to that location, eg:
   
        ```PUBLIC_SERVER_ADDRESS = 'http://localhost:8009'```


4. Update the JavaScript dependencies and devDependencies
    In the project's `package.json` file from `stable/7.4.0` to `stable/7.5.0`:
    ```    
    {
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/7.5.0",
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "arches-dev-dependencies": "archesproject/arches-dev-dependencies#stable/7.5.0"
        }
    ```
    In your terminal navigate to the directory with your project's package.json file. Then run:

        yarn install

        
5. Start your application server in a separate terminal if it's not alreay running.

6. In the same terminal window where you ran `yarn` ( on the same level as `package.json` ), run `yarn start` or `yarn build_development`. This will generate your `media/build` directory.
   - If running your project in development:
     -  `yarn start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
      - `yarn build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
    - If running your project in production:
      - `yarn build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
      - Alternatively you can `cd ..` up a directory and run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assessts and also call `collectstatic`.
  

6. If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    collectstatic
    ```
    and restart your server
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```
