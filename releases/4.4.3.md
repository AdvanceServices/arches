### Arches 4.4.3 release notes

The Arches team has been busy improving Arches and fixing several bugs as well.
Below you'll find a listing of more changes included in the latest release.

Some of the highlights:

- Adds improvements and bug fixes to the v3 to v4 migration command
- Fixes bug preventing users from saving tiles with domain values of Null
- Improves error logging during collector sync
- Fixes Docker deployment - previously broken because the location of package.json changed between 4.4.1 and 4.4.2
- Removes hard-coded static file paths

#### Upgrading Arches

Users are encouraged to update at their earliest convenience. If you are upgrading from Arches 4.3, be sure to follow the project upgrade instructions to [4.4.1](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/stable/4.4.x/releases/4.4.1.md) through [4.4.2](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/stable/4.4.x/releases/4.4.2.md) before proceeding.

To upgrade you'll need to run the following command in your activated virtual environment.
```
pip install arches --upgrade --no-binary :all:
```

If you have Arches running on a web server such as Apache, be sure to update your static files directory and restart your web server.

As always the documentation can be found at <http://arches.readthedocs.io>

4.4.2 projects are compatible with 4.4.3 projects requiring no upgrade
