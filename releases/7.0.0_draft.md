    - ensure "webpack_loader" has been added to INSTALLED_APPS
    - add setting:
        WEBPACK_LOADER = {
            "DEFAULT": {

            },
        }

### Upgrading an Arches project
- copy `/webpack` directory from arches directory to the root directory of your project ( should be on the same level as `package.json`)
- ensure ARCHES_CORE_PATH and PROJECT_PATH in `webpack/webpack-paths.js` are pointing to the correct directories
- in `settings.py`:
    - add "webpack_loader" to list of INSTALLED_APPS
    - ensure STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(APP_ROOT, "staticfiles")
    - if overwriting STATICFILES_DIRS, add os.path.join(APP_ROOT, "media", "build") **before** os.path.join(APP_ROOT, "media")
    - add setting:
        WEBPACK_LOADER = {
            "DEFAULT": {
                "STATS_FILE": os.path.join(APP_ROOT, "webpack/webpack-stats.json"),
            },
        }
- run `yarn`, this will install new frontend dependencies
- run `yarn test` or `yarn start`, this should generate compiled frontend files in `media/build`
- NOTE: If new JavaScript files have been created in your project, they may cause errors during the build process. You may need to troubleshoot these
        errors on a case-by-case basis until the application is able to build successfully
