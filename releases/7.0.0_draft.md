2. If you are running Arches on Apache, be sure to run:

    ```
    python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
    ```
    and restart your server.
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

3. Finally, If you are running Celery, you should also restart your Celery worker(s). The process for doing this depends on how Celery is being run.
