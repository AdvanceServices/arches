        pip install --upgrade arches==6.2.6

3. Update your Javascript dependencies

    Navigate to the directory with your project's package.json file. This is located in the same directory as your project's settings.py file.
    Ensure your arches dependency points to either `#archesproject/arches#dev/6.2.x` or `#archesproject/arches#stable/6.2.6`.\
    For example:

        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#dev/6.2.x"
        }
    
    If upgrading from version <= 6.2.3 run:

        yarn install

    and restart your server.
    ```
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

2. Finally, If you are running Celery, you should also restart your Celery worker(s). The process for doing this depends on how Celery is being run.
